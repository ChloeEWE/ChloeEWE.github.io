        <p>This webpage is a group project that I worked on with four other students for a Human Computer Interaction class in fall 2017. I am espescially proud of the work that we did in making the time filtering useful and intuitive. </p>
        <p>We did multiple iterations of work on this website, including paper prototyping, heuristic evaluation, and user testing on both our paper prototype and multiple versions of our website. We took inspiration from filtering systems on shopping websites for our search bar, and looked at other schools course listing websites for how to display classes themselves.</p>
        <p>For the project, we use javascript and boostrap, as well as a JSON file to hold the information about the courses that our university offered in spring of 2018. </p>
        <p>The website is a user interface prototype, and not a fully functioning product. As a result, the database and back end were not our focus, and not all database information is available.</p>
