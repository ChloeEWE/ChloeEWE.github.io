Yay course listings!

All we're using is html css js\n
for css: i started off using scss (sass), because how can you go back to css after using scss.
	Make sure you update the style.scss file, not the other.
	If you haven't used it before --> http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html
js: using jquery
